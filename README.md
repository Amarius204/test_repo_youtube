#This repo will be used primarily for testing and expirmenting with new projects in Python, as well as just general familiarization with git and GitHub tools.

#Followed Tech with Tim's beginner Python projects series, successfully completing 4 out of the 5 projects. (Skipped the 4th project since it didnt seem necessary to learn)
